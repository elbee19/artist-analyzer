Artist Analyzer is a single-page app(SPA) that, given an Artist's name, tell you the sentiment of some of their top songs.

Songs with thumbs up against them are ones with positive sentiments, and ones with thumbs down against them are ones with negative sentiments.

This is my first SPA & my first experience with Ruby & Rails. Please feel free to shoot suggestions at amitruparel91@gmail.com

Note:
- The app only pulls about 20 songs for a given artist.
